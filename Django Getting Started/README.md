# Getting Started With Django

I created a virtual environment and a new django environment

The procedures are as follows:

- py -3 -m venv myvenv // To create a virtual environment called myvenv

- myvenv\scripts\activate //To activate the virtual environment

- pip install django // To install django in the virtual environment

- django-admin startproject Drize // To create a project folder called Drize
